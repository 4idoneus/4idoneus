### Introduction

I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at Manisa Celal Bayar University and an active Working Group Member of the European COST Action CA22145 (GameTable).
My academic focus is defined by a specific pursuit: bridging the "Epistemic Gap" between high-performance Deep Learning models and human cognitive understanding. I operate under the handle Aidoneus—a reference to the "Unseen"—reflecting my goal to make the hidden logic of "Black Box" algorithms visible, explainable, and pedagogically valuable.

### Research Focus

My primary area of interest lies at the intersection of **Cognitive Game AI, Explainable AI (XAI), and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. I investigate how neural networks process strategic decisions in traditional board games (specifically Go/Weiqi) and how these machine intuitions can be translated into human-readable concepts (Chunking).

**Key Methodologies:**
* **Axiomatic Attribution**: Utilizing Integrated Gradients (IG) and Grad-CAM to visualize neural network rationale, deliberately moving beyond unstable methods like LIME.

* **Deep Learning & Computer Vision**: Developing Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet architectures) and Object Detection models (YOLO) for board state evaluation and digitization.

* **Cognitive Alignment**: Translating statistical AI outputs into "Interaction Primitives" to foster human cognitive skill acquisition.

### Selected Archives

**1. [Beyond the Move: Phase I](https://github.com/4idoneus/beyond-the-move-phase-one)**
*Status: Graduation Project I (Final Report Published)*
A "Glass Box" Deep Learning framework designed to open the black box of Go AI engines. This project utilizes a ResNet-18 model trained on 150,000+ professional games and implements Integrated Gradients to visualize the strategic rationale behind expert move generation.
**Live Demo:** [Streamlit Page](https://beyondthemovephase1.streamlit.app/)

**2. Beyond the Move: Phase II (In Progress)**
*Status: Pre-Graduate Research / IEEE CoG Preparation*
Transitioning from pixel-level attribution to high-level "Intuition Modeling." Upgrading the visual pipeline with YOLOv8 for robust physical board detection and implementing Grad-CAM to capture human-like "Chunking" and shape recognition (e.g., Atsumi).

### Professional Network & Publications

I am open to academic collaboration and discussion regarding AI ethics and game strategy.
